/**

 A `Toast` encapsulates the following points

 + What a toast notification contains
 + Where a toast notification will be presented
 + How a toast notification will be presented

 If the context where the toast is presented only involves presentation of
 single isolated toast messages, then showing a toast by itself is safe.

 In conditions where multiple toasts messages are shown in a short period of
 time, it is recommended to use a `ToastQueue` to control the presentation
 of the toast.
