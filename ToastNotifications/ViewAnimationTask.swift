/**
 The `ViewAnimationTask` encapsulates the code and data associated with a view
 animation task.

 A `ViewAnimationTask` object is a single-shot object that will animate its view
 with its animation.

 The animation is triggered by calling its `animate` method. When added to a
 `ViewAnimationTaskQueue`, it will be processed serially in a FIFO order.

 If the `ViewAnimationTask` finished its animation it will call its queue
 callback to notifiy. If the animation is cut short the queue is not notified
