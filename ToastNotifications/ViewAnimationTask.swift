 The `ViewAnimationTask` encapsulates the code and data associated with a view
 animation task.

 A `ViewAnimationTask` object is a single-shot object than can only be executed
 once.

 A `ViewAnimationTask` is executed by calling it `animate()` method or by adding
 it to a `ViewAnimationTaskQueue`. The queue will process it serially in a FIFO
 order.

 A `ViewAnimationTask` maintain state information via internally to notify the
 queue is contained by when the task finished execution.
