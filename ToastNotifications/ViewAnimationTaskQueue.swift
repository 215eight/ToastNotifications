 them

 allowed

 + Idle: Queue just processed a task. Waiting to process additional
 tasks if exist or to finish execution

 A `ViewAnimationTaskQueue` coordinates the execution of `ViewAnimationTask`
 objects. When a task is added to the queue it will start execution immediately
 as long as there are no other task being processed. Tasks are processed in a
 FIFO serial order

 When a `ViewAnimationTaskQueue` object is initialized, all tasks intended for
 processing should be added. Once the queue starts processing, by colling its
 `process()`, no more tasks can be queued.

 A queue is a single-shot object, once it has finished processing all its tasks,
 the queue should be disposed.
